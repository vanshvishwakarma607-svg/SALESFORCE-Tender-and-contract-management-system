PHASE 5: Apex Programming (Developer)

focuses on implementing custom business logic using Apex programming to automate processes, enforce rules, and handle complex scenarios that go beyond standard Salesforce automation tools.

1. Classes & Objects

Encapsulate logic in Apex Classes for reusability and modularity.

Create objects (variables, sObjects) to represent and manipulate Salesforce records.

2. Apex Triggers (before/after insert/update/delete)

Automate actions on Salesforce records when they are created, updated, deleted, or undeleted.

Example: Automatically update related Bids when a Tender is approved.

3. Trigger Design Pattern

Use one trigger per object.

Delegate logic to a handler class to keep triggers clean and maintainable.

4. SOQL & SOSL

SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) → Query Salesforce records.

SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language) → Search text across multiple objects.

5. Collections: List, Set, Map

List: Ordered collection of records.

Set: Unique collection of values.

Map: Key-value pair collection, useful for fast lookups.

6. Control Statements

Use if, else, loops, switch statements to control the flow of your Apex logic.

7. Batch Apex

Handle large volumes of data asynchronously.

Process records in batches to avoid governor limits.

8. Queueable Apex

Run asynchronous operations with more flexibility than future methods.

Chain jobs for complex processing sequences.

9. Scheduled Apex

Automate periodic tasks, like daily updates, reminders, or calculations.

10. Future Methods

Execute operations asynchronously to improve performance and avoid delays in UI.

11. Exception Handling

Use try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully and log exceptions.

12. Test Classes

Write unit tests for triggers and classes to ensure code coverage (minimum 75% for deployment).

Simulate real scenarios and validate expected outcomes.

13. Asynchronous Processing

Combine Batch, Queueable, and Future methods for efficient, long-running operations.
