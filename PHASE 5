PHASE 5: Apex Programming (Developer)

focuses on implementing custom business logic using Apex programming to automate processes, enforce rules, and handle complex scenarios that go beyond standard Salesforce automation tools.

1. Classes & Objects

Encapsulate logic in Apex Classes for reusability and modularity.

Create objects (variables, sObjects) to represent and manipulate Salesforce records.

2. Apex Triggers (before/after insert/update/delete)

Automate actions on Salesforce records when they are created, updated, deleted, or undeleted.

Example: Automatically update related Bids when a Tender is approved.

3. Trigger Design Pattern

Use one trigger per object.

Delegate logic to a handler class to keep triggers clean and maintainable.

4. SOQL & SOSL

SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) → Query Salesforce records.

SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language) → Search text across multiple objects.

5. Collections: List, Set, Map

List: Ordered collection of records.

Set: Unique collection of values.

Map: Key-value pair collection, useful for fast lookups.
