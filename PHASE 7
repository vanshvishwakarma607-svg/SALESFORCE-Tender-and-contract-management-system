Phase 7: Integration & External Access

This phase focuses on connecting Salesforce with external systems, automating data exchange, and managing API access.

1️⃣ Named Credentials

Store authentication settings for external systems securely.

Example: Connecting to a vendor’s procurement API.

Avoid hardcoding credentials in Apex.

2️⃣ External Services

Register and invoke APIs from external systems directly in Salesforce.

Example: Fetch live pricing data from a supplier portal.

3️⃣ Web Services (REST/SOAP)

Create Apex classes to consume or expose REST/SOAP services.

Example: REST API to submit bid details from an external portal.

4️⃣ Callouts

Use HTTP Callouts to integrate Salesforce with external APIs.

Example: Push contract approvals to an external project management tool.

5️⃣ Platform Events

Use event-driven architecture to trigger actions in real-time.

Example: Notify external systems when a tender is approved.

6️⃣ Change Data Capture

Monitor Salesforce record changes in real-time.

Example: Automatically sync updates on Contracts to ERP systems.

7️⃣ Salesforce Connect

Access external objects and data without storing it in Salesforce.

Example: View supplier bids from external database within Salesforce UI.

8️⃣ API Limits

Monitor and manage API usage to avoid hitting limits.

Example: Limit external integrations to prevent exceeding daily API calls.

9️⃣ OAuth & Authentication

Securely authenticate Salesforce with external apps.

Example: OAuth 2.0 flow for integrating with partner systems.

10️⃣ Remote Site Settings

Register external endpoints to allow Salesforce callouts.

Example: Add supplier API URL in Remote Site Settings to enable communication.
