ðŸ“Œ Phase 3: Data Modeling & Relationships


1. Standard & Custom Objects

Standard Objects

Account â†’ Represents Contractor/Company

Contact â†’ Represents People (Contract Manager, Procurement Officer)

User â†’ Internal Salesforce Users (roles like Manager, Bidder)

Custom Objects (You create in Setup â†’ Object Manager â†’ New Object)

Tender__c â†’ Stores tender details

Bid__c â†’ Stores bids submitted by contractors

Contract__c â†’ Stores awarded contract details

Project__c â†’ Tracks the project execution linked to contracts

Payment__c â†’ Stores payments made against contracts

ðŸ”¹ 2. Fields

Examples:

Tender__c â†’ Tender ID (Auto Number), Tender Name (Text), Status (Picklist: Open/Closed/Awarded)

Bid__c â†’ Bid ID (Auto Number), Amount (Currency), Status (Picklist: Pending/Approved/Rejected)

Contract__c â†’ Contract Value (Currency), Start Date (Date), End Date (Date)

Project__c â†’ Project Name (Text), Location (Text), Progress (%)

Payment__c â†’ Payment Date (Date), Payment Amount (Currency), Mode (Picklist: Bank Transfer, Cheque, Online)

ðŸ”¹ 3. Record Types

Tender__c â†’ Govt Tender, Private Tender

Contract__c â†’ Short-Term, Long-Term

ðŸ”¹ 4. Page Layouts

Tender__c â†’ Fields arranged for Procurement Officers (Name, Status, Start/End Dates, Related Bids)

Bid__c â†’ Layout for Bidders (Amount, Submitted Date, Tender Reference)

Contract__c â†’ Layout for Managers (Contract Value, Status, Related Payments/Projects)

ðŸ”¹ 5. Compact Layouts

Tender__c â†’ Show Tender Name, Status, Start Date, End Date

Bid__c â†’ Show Bid ID, Amount, Status

Contract__c â†’ Show Contract ID, Value, Status

ðŸ”¹ 6. Schema Builder

Use Setup â†’ Schema Builder

Add Tender__c, Bid__c, Contract__c, Project__c, Payment__c

Draw relationships between them â†’ this acts as your ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram).

ðŸ”¹ 7. Lookup vs Master-Detail vs Hierarchical Relationships

Tender__c â†’ Bid__c = Master-Detail (One Tender, many Bids)

Tender__c â†’ Contract__c = Lookup (One Tender leads to one Contract)

Contract__c â†’ Payment__c = Master-Detail (One Contract has many Payments)

Contract__c â†’ Project__c = Lookup (Link Project execution to Contract)

User Hierarchy (Role Reporting) = Hierarchical

ðŸ”¹ 8. Junction Objects (if needed)

If one Bid could be linked to multiple Tenders (rare, but possible), you would create a TenderBid__c junction object.
For now, your system doesnâ€™t require it, unless you want to extend functionality.
